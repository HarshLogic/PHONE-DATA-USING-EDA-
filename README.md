PHONE DATA USING EDA
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a mobile phone usage dataset to uncover key user behavior patterns and trends. The analysis focuses on understanding call and data usage across different networks, times of day, and months of the year to derive actionable business insights.

üöÄ Key Findings
Data vs. Calls: Data usage and session durations are significantly higher than call activity, reflecting a clear shift towards internet-based communication.

Peak Usage Times: Phone usage is highest during evening hours and on weekends, indicating when users are most engaged.

Network Popularity: A few network providers, notably Vodafone and Tesco, have the highest usage frequency, suggesting they are the most popular choices among users.

Actionable Insights: The analysis provides a strong foundation for data-driven decisions, including network optimization, targeted marketing campaigns, and new plan designs.
